      <p className="text-sm">
        "Parent" refers to a biological or adoptive parent or a person determined by the state to be a parent (for example, if the parent is listed on the birth 
        certificate). Grandparents, foster parents, legal guardians, older siblings, and uncles or aunts are not considered parents on this form unless they 
        have legally adopted you. If your legal parents are living and married to each other, answer the questions about both of them. If your legal parents 
        are not married and live together, answer the questions about both of them. In case of divorce or separation, give information about the parent 
        you lived with most in the last 12 months. If you did not live with one parent more than the other, give information about the parent who provided 
        you the most financial support during the last 12 months or during the most recent year you received support. If your divorced or widowed parent 
        has remarried, also provide information about your stepparent.
